This Ramadan, thanks to your generous support, Probhat Foundation was able to bring smiles to hundreds of families. Our team worked tirelessly to identify the most needy households in 10 remote villages.

Each food package contained 20kg of essentials, including rice, lentils, oil, sugar, gram, and dates. For many recipients, this support meant they could focus on their prayers and fasting without the anxiety of where their next meal would come from.

> "I was worried how I would feed my children this Ramadan. Probhat Foundation came as a blessing." - Fatema Begum, Villager.

We thank all our donors and volunteers who made this possible. May your contributions be accepted.
