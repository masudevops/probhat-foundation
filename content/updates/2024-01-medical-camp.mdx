Our winter medical camp in Sylhet was a huge success. With a team of 5 doctors and 10 volunteers, we were able to provide free checkups and medicine to over 300 patients in a single day.

Given the harsh winter, many patients presented with respiratory issues and cold-related illnesses. We distributed cough syrups, antibiotics (as prescribed), and warm clothing to those in need.

A special thanks to Dr. Ahmed for leading the medical team and coordinating the pharmacy supplies.
