We are thrilled to announce the opening of a small community library in Char Kaliganj. This facility will serve over 200 children in the area who previously had no access to reading materials outside of their textbooks.

The library is stocked with storybooks, encyclopedias, and educational games. It also serves as a safe space for after-school study sessions.

This project was completed in record time thanks to the local youth volunteers who helped with painting and setting up the furniture.
