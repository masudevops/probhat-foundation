## Overview

Ramadan is a time of reflection and giving. Our Ramadan Relief program ensures that the most vulnerable families in our communities can observe the holy month with dignity and without the worry of hunger.

## What We Do

*   **Iftar Distribution**: Daily cooked meals for orphans and the homeless.
*   **Zakat Management**: We collect and distribute Zakat funds strictly according to Islamic principles to eligible recipients.

## Impact

*   **1,000+** families received food packages in 2024.
*   **15,000** hot Iftar meals served.

## Share Your Blessings
