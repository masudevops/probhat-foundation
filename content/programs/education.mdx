## Overview

Education is the cornerstone of development. Our Education Support Program aims to remove the financial barriers that prevent children in rural areas from attending school. We believe that every child deserves the opportunity to learn, dream, and achieve their full potential.

## How It Works

We identify vulnerable students through local community leaders and school teachers. Once identified, we provide comprehensive support that includes:

*   **School Supplies**: Distribution of notebooks, pens, schoolbags, and uniforms.
*   **Tuition Assistance**: Paying monthly school fees for families who cannot afford them.
*   **Scholarships**: Merit-based financial aid for high-performing students pursuing higher education.

## Eligibility Criteria

1.  family income below the poverty line.
2.  Enrolled in a recognized educational institution.
3.  Demonstrated commitment to studies (attendance and performance).

## Impact Goals

Our education support program aims to:

*   Provide school supplies to students in underserved communities
*   Offer tuition assistance to families facing financial barriers
*   Support merit-based scholarships for dedicated students

Impact metrics will be documented and published as the program progresses.
