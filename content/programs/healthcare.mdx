## Overview

Access to basic healthcare is a luxury for many in the remote villages we serve. Our Healthcare Assistance program bridges this gap by bringing medical professionals to the doorstep of those in need and providing financial safety nets for medical emergencies.

## How It Works

*   **Free Medical Camps**: We organize quarterly medical camps where volunteer doctors provide checkups, prescriptions, and basic medicines free of cost.
*   **Emergency Treatment Fund**: A dedicated fund to assist destitute families with costs for surgeries, hospitalizations, and critical medicines.
*   **Health Education**: Workshops on hygiene, maternal health, and disease prevention.

## Impact

*   **12** medical camps conducted in 2024.
*   **2,500+** patients treated.
*   **15** life-saving surgeries funded.

## Support This Life-Saving Work

$50 sponsors a medical checkup and medicine for 10 people at our camps.
