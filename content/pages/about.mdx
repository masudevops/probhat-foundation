## Our Beginning

Probhat Foundation was established with a clear and intentional vision: to build a structured, ethical, and community-driven platform that supports underserved communities in rural Bangladesh.

Currently in its founding phase, the foundation is laying the groundwork for transparent governance, accountable financial management, and sustainable program development. Rather than rushing into expansion, our focus is on building a strong foundation rooted in integrity and long-term impact.

Our initial efforts are centered in Dhaka Division, with community-based initiatives beginning in Narayanganj.
