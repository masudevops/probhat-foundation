## Our Story

Probhat Foundation began with a simple belief: that every sunrise brings the promise of a new beginning. Founded in 2020 by a group of dedicated volunteers in rural Bangladesh, we witnessed firsthand how small interventions could transform entire communities.

What started as a modest effort to distribute blankets during a harsh winter has grown into a comprehensive development organization. We realized that true change requires more than just seasonal relief; it demands sustainable solutions in education, healthcare, and community infrastructure.

Today, we operate across 25 villages, guided by our original mission: to empower the most vulnerable to break the cycle of poverty and build a future filled with dignity and hope.
